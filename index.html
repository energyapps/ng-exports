		<h2>U.S. Leads World in Natural Gas Exports</h2>
		<h3>The volume of natural gas exports increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2018</h3>

		<p>The United States became a net natural gas exporter on an annual basis—for the first time in nearly 60 years—in 2017 and continued to export more natural gas than it imported in 2018. The transition to net exporter occurred as natural gas production in the United States continued to grow, reducing pipeline imports from Canada and increasing exports, both by pipeline and as liquefied natural gas (LNG).</p>

		<p>U.S. total natural gas exports grew 14% in 2018, and LNG exports grew by 53%. In September 2018, the United States exported more natural gas by pipeline than it imported by pipeline for the first time in at least 20 years. Forecasts in EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook show that natural gas exports by pipeline will exceed natural gas imports by pipeline in 2019 for the year.</p>
